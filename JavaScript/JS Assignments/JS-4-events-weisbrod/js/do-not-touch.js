  window.alert("This first one will NOT need conditional (if) structures. Remember to first create addEventListener code. To the left of 'addEventListener', mention the item that's to be clicked: in this case, the button that has id=\"amount-submit\". Have it call a function with a name of your choice. Elsewhere in your code, define that function. In the curly braces of that function, make an alert. In the parentheses of the alert, place the string message with quotes around it, then have a concatenatipn operator, then reference what the user typed in the field (and remember when you GET info from a form element, you say value not innerHTML). Then, still inside the alert parentheses, perform a math operation on that value, factoring in the service charge. You may need parentheses to change the order of operations, and you may need to wrap a Number() method around the value to convert it to a number.");

function hint2(){
  window.alert("First create addEventListener code like you did above, mentioning the select element as the item that's to be interacted with. But this time 'click' is not the event; choosing a select option triggers a DIFFERENT kind of event. Then, as you define the function that the event listener calls, in its curly braces you will need a conditional structure. In its first condition in parentheses, use triple equals to compare what the user chose in the select element to one of the given values--\"sad\", for example. After the condition parentheses close, open a nested set of curly braces, inside which you manipulate the style of the select element, setting its backgroundColor. After those curly braces, have an 'else if' with its own parentheses and condition, checking if the user chose \"curious\", and continue with that pattern... ");

function hint3(){
  window.alert("First create addEventListener code like you did above, but mention the FORM ITSELF as the item that's to be interacted with, choosing 'submit' as the event. Inside the curlies of the function it calls, you will need a conditional structure. In its first condition in parentheses, use the 'greater than' or 'less than' operator to compare what the user entered in the field to the number 123 (without quotes). After the condition parentheses close, open a nested set of curly braces, inside which you first have a line of code that prevents the form from doing its default action (submitting), then have a line with a console.log(). Follow those curlies with an 'else if' that checks a condition that's the opposite of the condition you already coded (was the number higher than 123? for example). Once both conditions and their curly brace code are finished, you won't need more code to cause entering 123 to submit the form, because if neither of those conditions were true, the form will skip running their code and will submit the form anyway");
