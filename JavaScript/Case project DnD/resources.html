        <h2>Here are some useful places to go:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://roll20.net/">roll20.net</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
            <b>Roll20 is a free website to connect to friends and play D&D together.</b><br>
            You can create a free account, join a game (or make your own!), invite your friends, and finally, you can
            start
            playing!<br>
            You can also <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search">browse the marketplace</a> for easy
            access
            to
            rulebooks, pre-made maps, character tokens, tilesets, and even entire modules.<br>
            There is also the <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex">D&D Compendium</a>, which is very
            useful
            for looking up spell effects, rules, classes, races, items, etc.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">dndbeyond.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 6%;">
            <b>D&DBeyond is another good free website.</b><br>
            This website lets you create characters at any time, while Roll20 only lets you create characters
            if you're already in a game.<br>
            D&DBeyond has its own <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace">marketplace</a> and compendiums of
            classes, spells, and more (found in the Game Rules and Sources dropdowns at the top of the
            <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">page</a>).<br>
            <i>However, since you can't directly play through D&DBeyond, you would need to buy resources from both
                Roll20 and D&DBeyond if you wanted to use them in both.</i><br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><i><u>Along with those popular websites, below are some more resources recommended to me:</u></i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <a href="https://5e.tools/">5e.tools</a> is yet another great website with a large database of different things.
            This might be the best database here.
            Highly recommended.
            <br>
            <a href="https://crobi.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/preview/quickref.html">Here</a> is a graphical page shared among the
            community that helps define a lot of things.
            Also highly recommended.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Of course, you can also use <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">the official website as well.</a></b>
            </li>
        </ul>
