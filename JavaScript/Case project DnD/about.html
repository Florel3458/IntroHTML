        <h2>This is the gist of Dungeons and Dragons:</h2>
        <p>
            If you've never played D&D, then it's definitely a lot to learn.<br>
            For example, you have to learn how to use all <i>seven dice!</i>
            <sub><small>...although one of them is just the D10 but more.</small></sub>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For starters, D&D is a TableTop RolePlaying Game (TTRPG).<br>
            This means that you will be playing a game where you act out your character while playing over a game board.<br>
            This <i>game board</i> could be a full detailed map from a game module, or it could just be a rough sketch of some areas and things to interact with.<br>
            A <i>game module</i> is basically an official (or maybe even homebrewed) story that you can go on with your adventuring party.<br>
            *These modules usually can stand alone, and you could bring your same character through multiple modules, hence being called a "module".<br>
            <i>Homebrew</i> is essentially custom content. If there's something you want to do that doesn't exist already, ask your DM if you can try to homebrew it!<br>
            <i>The Dungeon Master</i>, or <i>The Game Master</i>, abbreviated as DM or GM, is the person at the table that acts as the world builder...<br>
            They're the ones hyping up the big boss coming up, describing a dark room with flickering candles, playing as the monsters and NPCs of the world, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the best ways to learn how to play is just to ask other players in your games.<br>
            You can also learn on your own by looking stuff up on Google or Youtube, or you could use some of the resources on the <a href="resources.html">"Get started"</a> page.
