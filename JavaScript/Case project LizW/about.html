            <h2>This is the gist of Dungeons and Dragons:</h2>
            <p>
                If you've never played D&D, then it's definitely a lot to learn.<br>
                For example, you have to learn how to use all <i>seven dice!</i>
                <sub><small>...although one of them is just the D10 but extra...</small></sub>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For starters, D&D is a TableTop RolePlaying Game (TTRPG).<br>
                This means that you will be playing a game where you act out your character while playing over a game
                board.<br>
                This <b>game board</b> could be a full detailed map from a game module, or it could just be a rough
                sketch
                of some areas and things to interact with.<br>
                A <b>game module</b> is basically an official (or maybe even homebrewed) story that you can go on with
                your
                adventuring party.<br>
                These modules usually can stand alone, and you could bring your same character through multiple modules,
                hence being called a "module".<br>
                <b>Homebrew</b> is essentially custom content. If there's something you want to do that doesn't exist
                already, ask your DM if you can try to homebrew it!<br>
                <b>The Dungeon Master</b>, or <b>The Game Master</b>, abbreviated as <b>DM</b> or <b>GM</b>, is the
                person
                at the table that acts as the world builder...<br>
                They're the ones hyping up the big boss coming up, describing a dark room with flickering candles,
                playing
                as the monsters and NPCs of the world, etc.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to learn how to play is just to ask other players in your games.<br>
                You can also learn on your own by looking stuff up on Google or Youtube, or you could use some of the
                resources on the <a href="resources.html">"Get started"</a> page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A common way to get your character's stats is rolling 4 dice and taking the top 3 numbers. You put the
                numbers you roll into each of<br><b>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
                    Charisma.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="StatBlock">
            <p>You can either take the rolls 1 to 1 into their stats, or distribute them how you like.</p>
            <button onclick="rollStats();">Roll stats</button>
            <ul>
                <li id="statRoll1">＜08＞</li>
                <li id="statRoll2">＜12＞</li>
                <li id="statRoll3">＜13＞</li>
                <li id="statRoll4">＊＜15＞＊</li>
                <li id="statRoll5">＜14＞</li>
                <li id="statRoll6">＜10＞</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="rollTotal">Your total is 72...</p>
            <p id="rollFlavor">Click the button above to roll your stats.</p>
            <p id="rollHiFlavor">Having one or more stats be at least 15, or having balanced stats otherwise,<br>
                will usually let you build a good, fun character.</p>
