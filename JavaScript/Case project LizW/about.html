                    <h2>This is the gist of Dungeons and Dragons:</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you've never played D&D, then it's definitely a lot to learn.<br>
                        For example, you have to learn how to use all <i>seven dice!</i>
                        <sub><small>...although one of them is just the D10 but extra...</small></sub>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For starters, D&D is a TableTop RolePlaying Game (TTRPG).<br>
                        This means that you will be playing a game where you act out your character while playing over a
                        game
                        board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This <b>game board</b> could be a full detailed map from a game module, or it could just be a
                        rough
                        sketch
                        of some areas and things to interact with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <b>game module</b> is basically an official (or maybe even homebrewed) story that you can go
                        on
                        with
                        your
                        adventuring party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These modules usually can stand alone, and you could bring your same character through multiple
                        modules,
                        hence being called a "module".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Homebrew</b> is essentially custom content. If there's something you want to do that doesn't
                        exist
                        already, ask your DM if you can try to homebrew it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>The Dungeon Master</b>, or <b>The Game Master</b>, abbreviated as <b>DM</b> or <b>GM</b>, is
                        the
                        person
                        at the table that acts as the world builder...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They're the ones hyping up the big boss coming up, describing a dark room with flickering
                        candles,
                        playing
                        as the monsters and NPCs of the world, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the best ways to learn how to play is just to ask other players in your games.<br>
                        You can also learn on your own by looking stuff up on Google or Youtube, or you could use some
                        of
                        the
                        resources on the <a href="resources.html">"Get started"</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>A common way to get your character's stats is rolling 4 dice and taking the top 3 numbers. You
                        put
                        the
                        numbers you roll into each of<br><b>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
                            Charisma.</b>
                    </p>

                <div class="stat-block">
                    <p>You can either take the rolls 1 to 1 into their stats, or distribute them how you like.</p>
